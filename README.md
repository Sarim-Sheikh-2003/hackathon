Data available online about resource access and poverty rates for countries around the world isn't as visually available in a way that would make it easier for the user to view and compare the information. So we decided to focus on a way that not only makes it easy for the user to view and interact with the latest data from some Countries, but also compare the data from 2 different countries by various metrics. 

This is a React application that solves the above problem by creating a user-friendly interactive website that displays the data through interactive maps and comparison charts.
